## Please follow the following steps:
1. Create virtual environment for this repository  
```
virtualenv env_RM
```
2. Activate the created environment
```
source env_RM/bin/activate
```
3. git clone the repository to your folder
```
git clone https://github.com/yangbin-xd/radio-map.git
```
4. cd to the folder
```
cd radio-map
```
5. pip install required modules according to the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
```
6. __Please uninstall the numpy with high version__
```
pip uninstall numpy
```
7. __And degrade the numpy version to 1.19.5__
```
pip install numpy==1.19.5
```

8. Then, you can run benchmark of location-based beamforming
```
python LBB.py
```
9. And benchmark of channel knowledge map
```
python CKM.py
```
10. Finally, the proposed radio map  
__(If you want to use the model trained by the author, you can annotate lines 62-66 of RM.Py)__
```
python RM.py
```
