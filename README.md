source env_RM/bin/activate
```
__3. git clone the repository to your folder__
```
git clone https://github.com/yangbin-xd/radio-map.git
```
__4. cd to the folder__
```
cd radio-map
```
__5. pip install required modules according to the requirements__
```
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
```
__6. Please uninstall the numpy with high version__
```
pip uninstall numpy
```
__7. And degrade the numpy version to 1.19.5__
```
pip install numpy==1.19.5
```
__8. Then, you can run benchmark of location-based beamforming__
```
python LBB.py
```
__9. And benchmark of channel knowledge map__
```
python CKM.py
```
__10. Finally, the proposed radio map__  
__(If you want to use the model trained by the author, you can annotate lines 62-66 of RM.py)__
```
python RM.py
