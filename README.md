## 🛠️ Please follow the following steps:
__1. Configure virtual environment for this repository__   
```python
# Create virtual environment for this repository (pip install virtualenv)  
virtualenv env_RM

# Activate the created environment
source env_RM/bin/activate
```

__2. Download the repository to local__
```python
# git clone the repository to your folder
git clone https://github.com/yangbin-xd/radio-map.git

# cd to the folder
cd radio-map
```

__3. Install the required modules__
```python
# pip install required modules according to the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps

#  Please uninstall the numpy with high version
pip uninstall numpy

# And degrade the numpy version to 1.19.5
pip install numpy==1.19.5
```

__4. Then, you can run files__
```python
# benchmark of location-based beamforming
python LBB.py

# And benchmark of channel knowledge map
python CKM.py

# Finally, the proposed radio map 
# If you want to use the model trained by the author, you can annotate lines 62-66 of RM.py
python RM.py
```
